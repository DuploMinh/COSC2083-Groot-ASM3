|     Phat Bui     |     He works hard and I admit that he is somewhat a better leader than most others and he did more work compared to other members. However, I wish he would just communicate a bit more with the team rather than just giving orders and   deadlines.    |     I believe the work that I put in the documentation parts was good enough as it did fulfill the requirements for the part I was assigned (before it was changed). I wish I could communicate more when we were working but half of   the members already are friends, so I ended up trying to not get alienated and not really speaking my mind.    |     I don’t   know much about him since we didn’t really converse with each other aside from some questions and me agreeing with one of his ideas. Other than that,   he did his fair share of work, and he also works on the website.     |     He did   the part he was assigned to, and he also did it on time but he didn’t really talk much to the team.                       |
|     Minh Vu      |     Performed superbly, provided the team with a great framework for the project                                                                                                                                                                         |     Works   may not be up to the overall standard but not too bad for someone in their first semester                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     Did his   part for the group in a timely and adequate manner.

|     Long         |     Work incredibly hard, dedicate all of his time in finishing all of the tasks, very talkative (which is nice as it helps the flow of the work to be more comfortable)                                                                                 |     Upload   his work to the group folder on time, doesn’t talk much but still try to communicate with everyone to an extent                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     Collaborate   well with the group, engage in multiple conversion to boost the group communication, always on the lookout to fixed mistakes and errors                                                                                  |     Act as a support role, a bit shy so don’t talk much beside from the occasion responds to work related topic, did work on time      |
