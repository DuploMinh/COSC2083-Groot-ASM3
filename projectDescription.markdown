## Aims


The aim for our group’s project is to produce a chess game to players who are staying home during the pandemic time interval and enjoy a challenging strategy/puzzle game.  To build such a playable and enjoyable chess games, we are going to introduce these features into our game:

* Time Challenge: A clock time will test player’s ability to make right and fast decisions on their pawns’ moves.
* Puzzle Mode: Pre-designed chess games that will test the ability of player to turn the tide of the battle.
* Player vs Player Mode: Allow two players to compete

Aside from those advance game modes we just introduced, we also must make sure that the game is operating well with normal standard for chess rules, as well as the Artificial Intelligence of the game to help it beats toughest players.

When it comes to project, task-prioritizing and planning are the most important aspects. Building a fully functional chess game is the most important thing to do in our project. We must make sure that the game is working properly with normal game mode. This is the core of the game since it derives the gameplay, game AI, and so much more. Subsequently, we can build extra features and game modes afterward for higher challenge to players.

## Plans and progress

### Motivation

Among four ideas of members in the group, we have chosen the “Game Building” idea because we all shared our passion for the gaming industry. We all wanted to experience and learn to build a game ourselves.

### Plan

We have worked together to form up a routine that will bring the project to success. The following tasks are the things that need to be done to complete the project:

* Idea Discussion: Forming Ideas
* Establish Collaboration Environment: Choose tools to organize group activities
* Planning: Forming plans and tasks for the project
* Documentation:  Record project’s progress
* Gameplay: Design Gameplay
* Graphical User Interface: Design user interface
* Rules (Game): Design help settings
* Clock-timing (Game): Build timing features
* Puzzle (Game): Build puzzle features

In the following sections, we would like to provide specification and details to the proposed tasks. Moreover, we will discuss further changes in the future on how these tasks will be potentially modified, according to the project’s progress.

#### Idea discussion

We formed out group in week 8, which is 4 weeks left from the end of the semester. We wanted to make a group discussion on project’s idea first, as well as deciding other elements and factors. Without a project’s idea, we couldn’t initiate any plans and aims for the project.

We wanted to choose the ideas from the members of the group because we scanned through all the ideas, and recognized these ideas were properly developed and had potential for future expansion. We initially had to choose between these four topics coming from all the members:

* Game Collection Development
* Vietnamese grammar correction
* Robotics
* Mobile Game

We have chosen the “Game Collection Development” idea because it was fascinating, and we believe that the project will be successful. Moreover, it is practical to achieve because we have the knowledge and the abilities to achieve the goals by completing simple games first, before moving on to difficult ones. That’s why we named it Game Collection.   

#### Establish collaboration environment

A group project needs an environment that enables collaboration, teamwork for  efficiency. Moreover, constant communication helps to resolve  misunderstanding, as well as ensure that everyone is catching up to the deadlines and being responsible for their work. Likewise, team members are encouraged to exchange their questions and ideas clearly and effectively to other members.

We have chosen GitHub – A cloud repository that enables real-time collaboration – to store our codes, as well as keeping track of changes and modifications of the versions. Likewise, we use Messenger as a communication channel for members because Vietnamese students use Facebook as a common social media platform to exchange information, as well as updating their social life. Since we are practicing social distance in the next couple weeks, an online communication channel is a must for maintaining schedules and group activities. These tools have shown positive results on communication activities since we started to use these tools, thus, we will maintain the positivity.
 
Finally, we will use Google Drive to store the versions of the document files, since we will be updating the files regularly where technical document is distributed evenly to group members. This will help the team to collaborate real time with editing and updating the documents, and records modifications and adjustments made by members for fast recovery from fatal mistakes.

#### Planning

With all the tools prepared, we’ve started to create plans, goals and aims for the project’s success. Since we started from week 8, we had 3 weeks from the due date of the project’s documentation and presentation. With such a time-constraint, we decided that completing the documentation for the project is out top priority. Nonetheless, we will attempt to build the Gameplay for the project.
