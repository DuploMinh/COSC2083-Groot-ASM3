## Aims


The aim for our group’s project is to produce a chess game to players who are staying home during the pandemic time interval and enjoy a challenging strategy/puzzle game.  To build such a playable and enjoyable chess games, we are going to introduce these features into our game:

* Time Challenge: A clock time will test player’s ability to make right and fast decisions on their pawns’ moves.
* Puzzle Mode: Pre-designed chess games that will test the ability of player to turn the tide of the battle.
* Player vs Player Mode: Allow two players to compete

Aside from those advance game modes we just introduced, we also must make sure that the game is operating well with normal standard for chess rules, as well as the Artificial Intelligence of the game to help it beats toughest players.

When it comes to project, task-prioritizing and planning are the most important aspects. Building a fully functional chess game is the most important thing to do in our project. We must make sure that the game is working properly with normal game mode. This is the core of the game since it derives the gameplay, game AI, and so much more. Subsequently, we can build extra features and game modes afterward for higher challenge to players.

## Plans and progress

### Motivation

Among four ideas of members in the group, we have chosen the “Game Building” idea because we all shared our passion for the gaming industry. We all wanted to experience and learn to build a game ourselves.

### Plan

We have worked together to form up a routine that will bring the project to success. The following tasks are the things that need to be done to complete the project:

* Idea Discussion: Forming Ideas
* Establish Collaboration Environment: Choose tools to organize group activities
* Planning: Forming plans and tasks for the project
* Documentation:  Record project’s progress
* Gameplay: Design Gameplay
* Graphical User Interface: Design user interface
* Rules (Game): Design help settings
* Clock-timing (Game): Build timing features
* Puzzle (Game): Build puzzle features

In the following sections, we would like to provide specification and details to the proposed tasks. Moreover, we will discuss further changes in the future on how these tasks will be potentially modified, according to the project’s progress.

#### Idea discussion

We formed out group in week 8, which is 4 weeks left from the end of the semester. We wanted to make a group discussion on project’s idea first, as well as deciding other elements and factors. Without a project’s idea, we couldn’t initiate any plans and aims for the project.

We wanted to choose the ideas from the members of the group because we scanned through all the ideas, and recognized these ideas were properly developed and had potential for future expansion. We initially had to choose between these four topics coming from all the members:

* Game Collection Development
* Vietnamese grammar correction
* Robotics
* Mobile Game

We have chosen the “Game Collection Development” idea because it was fascinating, and we believe that the project will be successful. Moreover, it is practical to achieve because we have the knowledge and the abilities to achieve the goals by completing simple games first, before moving on to difficult ones. That’s why we named it Game Collection.   

#### Establish collaboration environment

A group project needs an environment that enables collaboration, teamwork for  efficiency. Moreover, constant communication helps to resolve  misunderstanding, as well as ensure that everyone is catching up to the deadlines and being responsible for their work. Likewise, team members are encouraged to exchange their questions and ideas clearly and effectively to other members.

We have chosen GitHub – A cloud repository that enables real-time collaboration – to store our codes, as well as keeping track of changes and modifications of the versions. Likewise, we use Messenger as a communication channel for members because Vietnamese students use Facebook as a common social media platform to exchange information, as well as updating their social life. Since we are practicing social distance in the next couple weeks, an online communication channel is a must for maintaining schedules and group activities. These tools have shown positive results on communication activities since we started to use these tools, thus, we will maintain the positivity.
 
Finally, we will use Google Drive to store the versions of the document files, since we will be updating the files regularly where technical document is distributed evenly to group members. This will help the team to collaborate real time with editing and updating the documents, and records modifications and adjustments made by members for fast recovery from fatal mistakes.

#### Planning

With all the tools prepared, we’ve started to create plans, goals and aims for the project’s success. Since we started from week 8, we had 3 weeks from the due date of the project’s documentation and presentation. With such a time-constraint, we decided that completing the documentation for the project is out top priority. Nonetheless, we will attempt to build the Gameplay for the project.

First, we started to work individually for the documentation since there are many aspects for writing. Each person was responsible for writing 2-3 parts of the documentation’s Project Description. The deadline for the documentation was scheduled to be on Sunday, September 5th, 2021. We specifically chose this date because we wanted to make sure that all members are doing good and allow flexibilities on time for making necessary changes on the documentation, as well as helping other members.  

Secondly, we will work together as a group to complete the other parts in the documentation that requires group collaboration, such as Group Reflection and Feedback. The deadline for this task is from September 5th to September 9th. Since these needs group activities heavily, we will be actively engaging in daily conversation with other team members for improvements and help.

Next, we’d like to design the web site for our documentation, which will be done  by Minh Vu. We will apply some JavaScript programming language to design and decorate our website. We would like to provide functions such as Button and for cross-reference between each section, as well as Hyperlink for reference to our presentation video and website sources that we used.

Next up, we will be working on our presentation video for project submission.	We will be discussing over our ideas, initial goals and aims, progress, achievements, experiences, and future goals. We will create PowerPoint slides to improve visual experiences and understanding of audience on the presentation, as well as present our products in better details.

Simultaneously, we will start to build and develop the game application. We will start off our game collection with building a chess game. We would like to spend the last 4 weeks of the semester to complete our documentation, as well as build at least the gameplay feature for the project. If we have an extra 12 weeks for this project, we will complete the advance game modes for the game, as well as build at least one extra game (Tetris, Chinese chess games, etc.). Specifically, for the chess game implementation, details will be discussed further in the following sections.

Finally, we would like to complete the project by submitting all files and documentations regarding the project by September 19th, 2021. We assigned the responsibility to Dinh Pham for the submission, avoiding collisions where the files are submitted multiple times (avoid wrong file-version submission).

#### Documentation

Documents are written and saved as doc files. We will apply rules and fonts design to protect the consistency of the documentations. Specifically, we will be using mainly Times New Roman font, with a font size of 12, and 1.5 line spacing for a clear visual.

All works and tasks were distributed evenly to all group members. All documentation is store on Google Drive, and dates are update regularly when changes are made to the files.

#### Web Design

The web is designed using pre-built format of Minh Vu. He has used this format for his website in Assignment 2 and he offered to use it for our project.

#### Presentation

Presentation is prepared with a PowerPoint slide, and recorded videos of four members. The final video will be submitted by combining these four videos. Group is not able to record a full video because we are practicing social distancing. 

#### Gameplay

First, we will make sure that the gameplay is matching with standards of available chess games on the market. Specifically, the game will apply standard chess rules. It will allow users to make their moves with a time ticking. The player will be able to choose the color for their pawns (as white will move first, and black moves after). The picture below (Nuwer, 2013) illustrates a sample of the project:

![]({{ site.url }}/COSC2083-Groot-ASM3/assets/Picture1.png)

Since we will be using Unity to implement this gameplay in 2D style, the above pictures illustrate our future product precisely. However, we will make essential changes to the chessboard color since the color in the picture is hard to differentiate, especially for color-blind users.

Moreover, there will be side-bar options for users to selectively choose to pause the game, exit the game, or make changes in the setting function. The AI of the game will be re-built with existed database and documentation of chess moves available on open sources such as personal projects, group projects, and personal blogs:

*	Easy: Intermediate AI level
*	Medium: Challenging AI level
*	Hard: Extreme Challenging AI level

We would be able to achieve easy AI for our product. However, Medium, and Hard mode are hard to design since we need to do lots of research on possible moves for the AI with little time we have.

There will also be a pop-up message where the user has conquered the game’s AI by checkmate, or vice versa. We will also consider a “Undo” button where it allows users to revert their moves, fixing their mistakes in Easy mode only.	Winner is decided by checkmate or the quantity of pawns they have left.

#### Graphical User Interface

We would like to design the GUI for the gameplay as aesthetics as possible, bring a decent experience for users. Since it is only a 2D game, it would be simple enough to build a simple GUI. With the help from Unity, this should be achievable.

#### Rules

Game rule follows the chess game rule standard, which can be found in the following hyperlinks:

[http://www.sakkpalota.hu/index.php/en/chess/rules](http://www.sakkpalota.hu/index.php/en/chess/rules)

[https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess)

Essentially, all rules will be implemented in the game where pawns will follow strictly. Error warnings will be generated when users attempt on impossible moves of a pawn.

#### Clock-timing

We will implement a clocking system which constrains single move of user by maximum of one minute, and a total of 60 minutes until the game is over. When	the clock exceeds 60 minutes, the game is over, and the winner is decided based on the existing pawns on the board of each side.

We believe this system provides a higher challenge to player. Moreover, it brings a true feeling to the player where they experience the format of a championship match.

#### Puzzle

We plan on building the puzzle mode where arranged gameplays are available for players to solve. These gameplays will mostly put players in difficult position of winning, thus challenging their abilities and tactics to recover from disadvantages. It is promising to bring a different taste to normal gameplays of players.

### Progress 

At the end of the project, we have completed the documentation and presentation parts. We have also started to design simple features of the games where we were designing the Easy mode for the Gameplay. It was harder than our initial expectations. We had to do such massive research on the implementation, as well as designs for the AI where it’s able to make its moves. Furthermore, designing the puzzles and time-clocking was also time consuming since we needed to apply math and GUI design. Overall, we were able to partially achieve the small goals of the initial plans. If we were given another 12 weeks, we believe we would be able to bring this project to success.

A more detail schedules will be discussed in the [Timeframe]() section. Please refer to this section for a more specific plan and explanation. 

## Roles

Since we are going to build a chess game on a 2D platform, we are using Unity as a game development tool. In a chess game building, these are roles that need to be filled:

*	AI Designer: Design game AI
*	GUI Designer: Design UI for the game
*	Puzzle Designer: Design puzzles for the game
*	Tester: These are players who would rate the performance of the game product
*	Unity Developer: Essential role for the game design
*	Project Leader: Make up plans and make sure the project does well.
*	Documentary: Record of project’s progress

Since this is an offline game, it won’t be available for sale on third-party markets such as Steam, Epic, etc. Therefore, there won’t be any roles related to Business and Marketing.

The table below illustrates the firm roles for group’s members:

|     Name         |     Roles                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
|     Dinh Pham    |     Puzzle Designer, Documentary    |
|     Minh Vu      |     Engine/AI designer              |
|     Long         |     Research, Survey                |
|     Phat Bui     |     Documentary, Unity Developer    |

## Scope & limit

### Scope

Our first aim for the project is to complete its documentation and preparation for actual project’s development in the future within the last four weeks of the semester. The documentation will keep track of records where we can trace back on what tasks and features were achieved, as well as making sure that we have back-up resources to present the product to our potential investors and clients in the future. 

Second project’s aim is to successfully build the chess game with extended advance features and game modes. The game will be developed after document’s completion, and the game-building period will be prolonged for 12 weeks. The game will be fully tested and improved by collecting user’s experience with surveys. 

### Limitation

Although we have developed a well-built plan for the project’s progression, we still have some issues regarding the use of game engine. Since we are students and financially limited on budget, we don’t have access to full package of Unity Engine. Using free version may restrict the implementation of some features in the game, such as settings and the general GUI of the game. The overall quality may not meet the player’s expectation and satisfaction. 

## Tools and Technologies

We have decided on choosing the Unity engine as it is relatively simple and easy to learn among the game engines commonly available on the market. The most recent stable version of the Unity engine and editor at the time of this text is 2021.1.19 is the version we will use. Unity engine uses C# as the scripting language. Unity is free for students and non-commercial projects so we will not have to pay for this. 

Deriving from this, Visual Studio will be the primary integrated development environment (IDE). It has good support for both C# and Unity development. We will use Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition as it is the most recent free-to-use edition of Visual Studio, compared to other versions that incur a license cost. The specific versions of the software we use may change through the project as new updates may be available. 

In addtition, we will need a server to run any network functions for our project. We will host this server on Azure as we in RMIT have free credit for this service. As we do not expect too many users for the duration of our project, we believe that one server will suffice though we can always increase the number of servers available. 

Our website will be hosted using GitHub pages as we have done with our previous assignment. We will use the Jekyll web framework to simplify the web development process. Minh has experience with C# and Visual Studio as well as some experience with developing Unity applications.

## Testing

For testing purposes, we will be sending invitations via banners and emails to RMIT students, as well as our friends for testing game demos. Ideally, we would like to invite at least 5 participants, but no more than 10 participants. These candidates will be given our product’s demos, and we will be recoding directly their real reactions, comments, and suggestions on the gameplay.

On the other hand, we will test the basic concept of our application by sending out surveys through RMIT email to as many recipients as possible. The surveys will be collecting player’s expectation, feedbacks and criticizes on the product. We would prefer to receiving approximately 100 responds from responders. These feedbacks will be powerful tool for the product’s revision on its features for improvements and bug fixes. Moreover, this will determine whether our features have been appropriate for the user pool. 

We will be producing game-demo (uncompleted product) when we implement a new feature into the product. The participants we’ve invited will be presented with these game demos and requested to complete trials for each function we were desired to collect feedbacks. We will conduct tests that will focus on product’s functionalities tests before requesting helps from our participants, making sure that testing plans are appropriate and reasonable. We want to make sure the tests will be as efficient and less time-consuming as possible for our group and the participants. 

Nevertheless, in each of the testing session, participants are required to note down their experience with the demos. There will be a lot of questions in our questionary list. Mostly, we want to receive their responses on the core questionnaire list implement changes accordingly. The following is a small sample of our questionnaires: 

*	Was the feature necessary?
*	Was the feature appropriate?
*	How satisfy was the participant with the implementation?
*	What was good?
*	What was not good?
*	What can be improved?
*	What features would be implemented next?
*	Other suggestions?

## Timeframe

In this section, we would like to provide the plans coming up right after our submission for the Assignment 3 due on September 19th, 2021. Absolutely, these plans are only approximate estimation for the future. As we go through each week activities, we will provide the tasks and goals we will aim for, as well as provide details explanation for those tasks and goals.

| Week 2  | 5.   Project Write-up                          | Second week is when we started to write up the project’s initial drafts. We focused mainly on the Project Description as it required the most writing works. At the end of the week, we worked together to write up the remaining parts of the Assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Risk 

Risk management is often defined as the methods of planning for unexpected events and controlling the risks to minimize the probability of failures and prevent the threats from expanding. As projects always carry risk, the most essential thing to look out for when managing the risks is identifying the key risk areas and analyzing the possible outcomes that might come out of those risks. With that being said, we have defined the potential risks and the solutions to them in the following table:

|    <br>Risks                               |    <br>Reasons                                                                                                                                                 |    <br>Solutions                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Group process and communication

As technological advancements of modern communication systems get better day by day, with innovations such as mobile phones and email systems, it allows us to stay connected with friend/family conveniently during this pandemic period. For our group, we decided that we would be communicating with each other through text format via Messenger (a chatting application of Facebook). Furthermore, we will be hosting weekly meetings with an online communication platform called Discord. 

This platform helpes our group to exchange information about ideas, questions, and research in a much more efficient way. We also wish to improve our productivity with shared schedules and weekly activity plans via an online cloud-based storage (Google Drive). Additionally, we are using GitHub along with Google Drive for real-time collaboration. They are strong tool for storing the documentary and code base of our project and keeping track with the changes of the project. 

Group members are expected to join all weekly meetings. Weekly meetings will be hosted once per week. Group members are in the same lecture and tutorial sessions so more than one meeting is not necessary. However, daily communication is conducted via Messenger every day, therefore members are expected to respond when they are tagged by other members within that day. Our group uses tagging for importance notice only. In special circumstances where they are unable to participate in the meetup, they should let all members know in advance, at least 3 days prior to the meetings. Missed information and tasks will be noted and relayed to the absent member. 

However, members who was absent would be demanded to attend the next meetings. Considering there are 16 weeks to develop the product, each member in the group is expected to join the group meeting weekly and respond to the group communication on the online platforms when there is notification about new updates and changes. They are not requested to respond immediately, but it’s a must to reply within that specific day. People who don’t respond over three times in a group meeting and miss over three meetings, will receive a lower distribution mark compares to other active members.
